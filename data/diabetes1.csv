Title,Abstract
Epidemiology of diabetes and diabetic complications in China,"The People’s Republic of China (herein referred to as China) has witnessed one of the most dramatic rises in diabetes prevalence anywhere in the world. The latest epidemiological study suggests that approximately 11% of the population has diabetes, with a significant proportion remaining undiagnosed. Risk factors for diabetes in the Chinese population are similar to those in other populations, though gestational diabetes and young-onset diabetes is becoming increasingly common. Data on the prevalence of diabetic complications remain limited, though cardio–renal complications account for significant morbidity and mortality. Other diabetes-related comorbidities are becoming increasingly common, with cancer emerging as a major cause of mortality among individuals with diabetes. There are many challenges and obstacles that impede effective diabetes prevention and the delivery of care, though much progress has occurred over recent years. Lessons learnt from how China has responded to the challenges posed by the diabetes epidemic will be invaluable for other countries facing the many threats of diabetes and its complications."
International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group criteria is suitable for gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosis:further evidence from China,"Background The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG) recommended new diagnostic criteria for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) after extensive analyses of the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) study.Unfortunately,there was no data from mainland of China in this study.We evaluated the feasibility of IADPSG criteria for GDM diagnosis in China.Methods A large prospective study was conducted.We reviewed medical records of a total of 25 674 pregnant women who underwent GDM screening and diagnosis between January 1,2005 and December 31,2012 in the Peking University First Hospital.The prevalence of gestational glucose metabolism abnormalities was calculated according to different cut off values defined by the National Diabetes Data Group (NDDG) or the IADPSG,and the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes related to GDM was analyzed.Results According to the cut off values of NDDG and IADPSG criteria,the prevalence of gestational glucose metabolism abnormalities was 8.4% and 18.9% (P <0.01) respectively,and the prevalence of cesarean section (52.5% vs.46.0% ,P <0.01),macrosomia (7.5% vs.6.3% ,P <0.05),neonatal hypoglycemia (1.6% vs.1.0% ,P <0.01),and perinatal death (0.5% vs.0.2% ,P <0.01); the prevalence was significantly lower when IADPSG criteria were applied.The prevalence of macrosomia,cesarean section,neonatal hypoglycemia,pregnancy induced hypertension,etc.was also higher in the GDM group than in the normal group.The prevalence of cesarean section (62.3%) and macrosomia (14.8%) was the highest in untreated mild GDM patients.Conclusions Our results indicated that treatment/intervention of women with GDM identified by IADPSG criteria was related to significantly lower risk of multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes.Such findings provide support for applying IADPSG criteria in China."
"Prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus of Chinese populations in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan","This article reviews and describes trends and differences in prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus of Chinese populations in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan based on literatures published in the MEDLINE Advanced database (January 1966–October 2005) in both Chinese and English languages. Chinese populations in Hong Kong and Taiwan have significant higher prevalence rates of diabetes than their Mainland counterparts, with odds ratios 1.5 (95% confidence intervals: 1.4, 1.7) and 2.0 (95% confidence intervals: 1.8, 2.2), respectively in 1995–2003 adjusted for age and diagnostic criteria. Using stratified diagnostic criteria; the odds ratios in Hong Kong and Taiwan were consistently higher than Mainland China for the periods of 1985–1994 and 1995–2003. A large proportion, i.e. 68.6% (95% confidence intervals: 67.4%, 69.7%) of diabetic patients remains undiagnosed in Mainland China as compared to 52.6% (95% confidence intervals: 49.8%, 55.5%) undiagnosed in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The prevalence rates of diabetes and impaired glucose toleranceof the Chinese populations rise in older age groups. In tandem with economic development and change toward lifestyle that is lack of physical activity and rich in high-fat diet, prevalence of diabetes of the Chinese populations are on the rise. If the undiagnosed individuals left uncontrolled, they are subject to higher risks of developing diabetes and its complications. These will increase the burdens of diabetes medically and financially."
Diabetes in China: a societal solution for a personal challenge,"China has a large burden of diabetes: in 2013, one in four people with diabetes worldwide were in China, where 11·6% of adults had diabetes and 50·1% had prediabetes. Many were undiagnosed, untreated, or uncontrolled. This epidemic is the result of rapid societal transition that has led to an obesogenic environment against a backdrop of traditional lifestyle and periods of famine, which together puts Chinese people at high risk of diabetes and multiple morbidities. Societal determinants including social disparity and psychosocial stress interact with factors such as low-grade infection, environmental pollution, care fragmentation, health illiteracy, suboptimal self-care, and insufficient community support to give rise to diverse subphenotypes and consequences, notably renal dysfunction and cancer. In the China National Plan for Non-Communicable Disease Prevention and Treatment (2012–15), the Chinese Government proposed use of public measures, multisectoral collaborations, and social mobilisation to create a health-enabling environment and to reform the health-care system. While awaiting results from these long-term strategies, we advocate the use of a targeted and proactive approach to identify people at high risk of diabetes for prevention, and of private–public–community partnerships that make integrated care more accessible and sustainable, focusing on registry, empowerment, and community support. The multifaceted nature of the societal and personal challenge of diabetes requires a multidimensional solution for prevention in order to reduce the growing disease burden."
Diabetes in China: Epidemiology and Genetic Risk Factors and Their Clinical Utility in Personalized Medication,"The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has rapidly increased over recent decades, and T2D has become a leading public health challenge in China. Compared with European descents, Chinese patients with T2D are diagnosed at a relatively young age and low BMI. A better understanding of the factors contributing to the diabetes epidemic is crucial for determining future prevention and intervention programs. In addition to environmental factors, genetic factors contribute substantially to the development of T2D. To date, more than 100 susceptibility loci for T2D have been identified. Individually, most T2D genetic variants have a small effect size (10–20% increased risk for T2D per risk allele); however, a genetic risk score that combines multiple T2D loci could be used to predict the risk of T2D and to identify individuals who are at a high risk. Furthermore, individualized antidiabetes treatment should be a top priority to prevent complications and mortality. In this article, we review the epidemiological trends and recent progress in the understanding of T2D genetic etiology and further discuss personalized medicine involved in the treatment of T2D."
"Prevalence and Treatment of Diabetes in China, 2013-2018","Importance  Recent data on prevalence, awareness, treatment, and risk factors of diabetes in China is necessary for interventional efforts.
Objective  To estimate trends in prevalence, awareness, treatment, and risk factors of diabetes in China based on national data.
Design, Setting, and Participants  Cross-sectional nationally representative survey data collected in adults aged 18 years or older in mainland China from 170 287 participants in the 2013-2014 years and 173 642 participants in the 2018-2019 years.
Exposures  Fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels were measured for all participants. A 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test was conducted for all participants without diagnosed diabetes.
Main Outcomes and Measures  Primary outcomes were diabetes and prediabetes defined according to American Diabetes Association criteria. Secondary outcomes were awareness, treatment, and control of diabetes and prevalence of risk factors. A hemoglobin A1c level of less than 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) among treated patients with diabetes was considered adequate glycemic control.
Results  In 2013, the median age was 55.8 years (IQR, 46.4-65.2 years) and the weighted proportion of women was 50.0%; in 2018, the median age was 51.3 years (IQR, 42.1-61.6 years), and the weighted proportion of women was 49.5%. The estimated prevalence of diabetes increased from 10.9% (95% CI, 10.4%-11.5%) in 2013 to 12.4% (95% CI, 11.8%-13.0%) in 2018 (P < .001). The estimated prevalence of prediabetes was 35.7% (95% CI, 34.2%-37.3%) in 2013 and 38.1% (95% CI, 36.4%-39.7%) in 2018 (P = .07). In 2018, among adults with diabetes, 36.7% (95% CI, 34.7%-38.6%) reported being aware of their condition, and 32.9% (95% CI, 30.9%-34.8%) reported being treated; 50.1% (95% CI, 47.5%-52.6%) of patients receiving treatment were controlled adequately. These rates did not change significantly from 2013. From 2013 to 2018, low physical activity, high intake of red meat, overweight, and obesity significantly increased in prevalence.
Conclusions and Relevance  In this survey study, the estimated diabetes prevalence was high and increased from 2013 to 2018. There was no significant improvement in the estimated prevalence of adequate treatment.

Prevalence of Diabetes among Men and Women in China,"BACKGROUND
Because of the rapid change in lifestyle in China, there is concern that diabetes may become epidemic. We conducted a national study from June 2007 through May 2008 to estimate the prevalence of diabetes among Chinese adults.
METHODS
A nationally representative sample of 46,239 adults, 20 years of age or older, from 14 provinces and municipalities participated in the study. After an overnight fast, participants underwent an oral glucose-tolerance test, and fasting and 2-hour glucose levels were measured to identify undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes (i.e., impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance). Previously diagnosed diabetes was determined on the basis of self-report.
RESULTS
The age-standardized prevalences of total diabetes (which included both previously diagnosed diabetes and previously undiagnosed diabetes) and prediabetes were 9.7% (10.6% among men and 8.8% among women) and 15.5% (16.1% among men and 14.9% among women), respectively, accounting for 92.4 million adults with diabetes (50.2 million men and 42.2 million women) and 148.2 million adults with prediabetes (76.1 million men and 72.1 million women). The prevalence of diabetes increased with increasing age (3.2%, 11.5%, and 20.4% among persons who were 20 to 39, 40 to 59, and ≥60 years of age, respectively) and with increasing weight (4.5%, 7.6%, 12.8%, and 18.5% among persons with a body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters] of <18.5, 18.5 to 24.9, 25.0 to 29.9, and ≥30.0, respectively). The prevalence of diabetes was higher among urban residents than among rural residents (11.4% vs. 8.2%). The prevalence of isolated impaired glucose tolerance was higher than that of isolated impaired fasting glucose (11.0% vs. 3.2% among men and 10.9% vs. 2.2% among women).
CONCLUSIONS
These results indicate that diabetes has become a major public health problem in China and that strategies aimed at the prevention and treatment of diabetes are needed."
"Prevalence of Diabetes and Its Risk Factors in China, 1994","OBJECTIVE
To determine the prevalence of diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and its risk factors in the Chinese population.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
This study was a population-based cross-sectional study of 224,251 residents aged 25–64 years in 19 provinces and areas, including cities and rural areas of the north, south, east, and middle part of China.
RESULTS
Using the 1985 World Health Organization criteria, the prevalence of diabetes and IGT was 2.5 and 3.2%, respectively, in 213,515 subjects aged 25–64 years. Two thirds (70.3%) of the cases had newly recognized diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes in China is about three times higher than it was 10 years ago. On average, subjects with diabetes are older, have higher personal annual incomes, and more often have a family history of diabetes. They also have higher mean BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and a greater prevalence of hypertension. They perform less physical activity and have less education than people with normal oral glucose tolerance test results. Multiple logistic stepwise regression analysis shows that age, BMI (or WHR), family history of diabetes, hypertension, less physical activity, and higher annual income are independent risk factors of NIDDM, and that low education is also an independent risk factor of NIDDM in people with higher personal annual income.
CONCLUSIONS
The prevalence of diabetes in China is increasing with economic development and changes from traditional to modernized lifestyle, especially where people had lower level of education and socioeconomic development. Therefore, Chinese people should attempt to retain certain features of their traditional lifestyle (physical activity, healthy food, moderate body weight). Increased knowledge of risk factors for diabetes may help to prevent a further rapid increase in the prevalence of diabetes in China."
The long-term effect of lifestyle interventions to prevent diabetes in the China Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Study: a 20-year follow-up study,"Background
Intensive lifestyle interventions can reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance, but how long these benefits extend beyond the period of active intervention, and whether such interventions reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality, is unclear. We aimed to assess whether intensive lifestyle interventions have a long-term effect on the risk of diabetes, diabetes-related macrovascular and microvascular complications, and mortality.

Methods
In 1986, 577 adults with impaired glucose tolerance from 33 clinics in China were randomly assigned to either the control group or to one of three lifestyle intervention groups (diet, exercise, or diet plus exercise). Active intervention took place over 6 years until 1992. In 2006, study participants were followed-up to assess the long-term effect of the interventions. The primary outcomes were diabetes incidence, CVD incidence and mortality, and all-cause mortality.

Findings
Compared with control participants, those in the combined lifestyle intervention groups had a 51% lower incidence of diabetes (hazard rate ratio [HRR] 0·49; 95% CI 0·33–0·73) during the active intervention period and a 43% lower incidence (0·57; 0·41–0·81) over the 20 year period, controlled for age and clustering by clinic. The average annual incidence of diabetes was 7% for intervention participants versus 11% in control participants, with 20-year cumulative incidence of 80% in the intervention groups and 93% in the control group. Participants in the intervention group spent an average of 3·6 fewer years with diabetes than those in the control group. There was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in the rate of first CVD events (HRR 0·98; 95% CI 0·71–1·37), CVD mortality (0·83; 0·48–1·40), and all-cause mortality (0·96; 0·65–1·41), but our study had limited statistical power to detect differences for these outcomes.

Interpretation
Group-based lifestyle interventions over 6 years can prevent or delay diabetes for up to 14 years after the active intervention. However, whether lifestyle intervention also leads to reduced CVD and mortality remains unclear.

Childhood Diabetes in China: Enormous variation by place and ethnic group,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate the incidence rate of IDDM in China.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
The Chinese IDDM registry was established in 1991 as part of the World Health Organization's Multinational Project for Childhood Diabetes (DiaMond) project. Twenty-two centers were developed to monitor the incidence of IDDM in children <15 years of age. The population under investigation includes >20 million individuals, representing ∼7% of the children in China. Capture-recapture methods were used to estimate the ascertainment.
RESULTS
The overall ascertainment-corrected IDDM incidence rate in China was 0.51 per 100,000, the lowest rate ever reported. There was a 12-fold geographic variation (0.13–1.61 per 100,000). In general, the incidence rate was higher in the north and the east. There was a sixfold difference among ethnic groups (highest: Mongol group, 1.82 per 100,000; lowest: Zhuang group, 0.32 per 100,000).
CONCLUSIONS
China has an extremely low overall IDDM incidence rate. China also has the greatest geographic and ethnic variation seen for any country."
Progress in diabetes research in China,"The prevalence of diabetes, especially Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is increasing markedly throughout the world, including in China. Because T2DM and its complications are associated with considerable socioeconomic burden and mortality, there is increasing interest in developing strategies to prevent or delay progression of the disease. In recent decades, many researchers have focused on the mechanism of onset of diabetes, as well as examining the benefits of various interventions in subjects with different glucose tolerance status to prevent or delay development of the disease. In the present article, we focus on five areas (epidemiology, early intervention, insulin sensitivity and β-cell function, adipocytokines, and traditional Chinese medicine) to review the progress of research into diabetes in China today. The prevalence of diabetes in China is one of the highest in the world. However, with lifestyle interventions and appropriate pharmacological therapies (including traditional Chinese medicine), T2DM may be prevented, well controlled, or even put into remission. Accurate estimation of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, as well as better characterization of the physiological function of adipocytokines, could give us a better understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying the onset of diabetes and could lead to better interventions in people with impaired glucose tolerance and T2DM."
"Frequency, Immunogenetics, and Clinical Characteristics of Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in China (LADA China Study): A Nationwide, Multicenter, Clinic-Based Cross-Sectional Study ","Adult non–insulin requiring diabetes includes latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA), distinguished from type 2 diabetes by the presence of islet autoantibodies. LADA China determined the characteristics of Chinese LADA. This nationwide, multicenter, clinic-based cross-sectional study was conducted in 46 university-affiliated hospitals in 25 Chinese cities. All 4,880 ketosis-free diabetic patients (<1 year postdiagnosis, without insulin therapy for >6 months, aged ≥30 years) had GAD antibody (GADA) and HLA-DQ genotype measured centrally with clinical data collected locally. GADA-positive subjects were classified as LADA. Of the patients, 5.9% were GADA positive with LADA. LADA showed a north-south gradient. Compared with GADA-negative type 2 diabetes, LADA patients were leaner, with lower fasting C-peptide and less metabolic syndrome. Patients with high GADA titers are phenotypically different from those with low GADA titers, while only a higher HDL distinguished the latter from those with type 2 diabetes. HLA diabetes–susceptible haplotypes were more frequent in LADA, even in those with low-titer GADA. HLA diabetes-protective haplotypes were less frequent in LADA. Our study implicates universal immunogenetic effects, with some ethnic differences, in adult-onset autoimmune diabetes. Autoantibody positivity and titer could be important for LADA risk stratification and accurate therapeutic choice in clinical practice."
Determination of diabetic retinopathy prevalence and associated risk factors in Chinese diabetic and pre-diabetic subjects: Shanghai diabetic complications study,"Background

The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy is not well studied in the Chinese pre-diabetic population, also known as impaired glucose regulation. Hence, we investigated the prevalence of and risk factors associated with retinopathy in diabetic and pre-diabetic subjects from Chinese communities.

Methods

A total of 3736 Chinese subjects were recruited from urban communities in Shanghai. The participants were classified as normal glucose tolerance, impaired glucose regulation (IGR) and diabetes based on the 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. The levels of diabetic retinopathy (DR) were assessed with non-mydriatic retinal photographs according to the Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Severity Scale.

Results

The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetes and impaired glucose regulation subjects was 9.4% and 2.5%, respectively. In subjects with IGR, hypertension (odds ratio: 3.54, p = 0.028), including elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure and obesity (odds ratio: 3.53, p = 0.028) were significantly associated with diabetic retinopathy after age and sex adjustments. The factors associated with retinopathy in diabetes included diabetes duration, blood glucose levels, glycated hemoglobin levels, and the presence of albuminuria. Diabetic retinopathy was significantly associated with fasting plasma glucose in known diabetes, whereas in newly-diagnosed subjects, diabetic neuropathy was closely correlated to postprandial plasma glucose.

Conclusions

Hyperglycemia was a strong risk factor for diabetic retinopathy. In pre-diabetic subjects, diabetic retinopathy was also associated with hypertension and obesity. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
Prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus in mainland China: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Aims/Introduction

Pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at a higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The aim of the present study was to estimate the pooled prevalence of GDM in mainland China according to International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups criteria.

Materials and Methods

We carried out a systematic review by searching both English and Chinese literature databases. Random effects models were used to summarize the prevalence of GDM in mainland China. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were carried out to address heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated using Egger's test.

Results

A total of 25 papers were included in the meta-analysis, involving 79,064 Chinese participants. The total incidence of GDM in mainland China was 14.8% (95% confidence interval 12.8–16.7%). Subgroup analysis showed that the age, bodyweight and family history of diabetes mellitus could significantly increase the incidence of GDM.

Conclusions

To the best of our knowledge, this systematic review is the first to estimate the pooled prevalence of GDM among women in mainland China according to International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups criteria. The results of our systematic review suggest a high prevalence of GDM in mainland China, indicating that this country might have the largest number of GDM patients worldwide."
