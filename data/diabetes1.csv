Epidemiology of diabetes and diabetic complications in China,"The People’s Republic of China (herein referred to as China) has witnessed one of the most dramatic rises in diabetes prevalence anywhere in the world. The latest epidemiological study suggests that approximately 11% of the population has diabetes, with a significant proportion remaining undiagnosed. Risk factors for diabetes in the Chinese population are similar to those in other populations, though gestational diabetes and young-onset diabetes is becoming increasingly common. Data on the prevalence of diabetic complications remain limited, though cardio–renal complications account for significant morbidity and mortality. Other diabetes-related comorbidities are becoming increasingly common, with cancer emerging as a major cause of mortality among individuals with diabetes. There are many challenges and obstacles that impede effective diabetes prevention and the delivery of care, though much progress has occurred over recent years. Lessons learnt from how China has responded to the challenges posed by the diabetes epidemic will be invaluable for other countries facing the many threats of diabetes and its complications."
International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group criteria is suitable for gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosis:further evidence from China,"Background The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG) recommended new diagnostic criteria for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) after extensive analyses of the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) study.Unfortunately,there was no data from mainland of China in this study.We evaluated the feasibility of IADPSG criteria for GDM diagnosis in China.Methods A large prospective study was conducted.We reviewed medical records of a total of 25 674 pregnant women who underwent GDM screening and diagnosis between January 1,2005 and December 31,2012 in the Peking University First Hospital.The prevalence of gestational glucose metabolism abnormalities was calculated according to different cut off values defined by the National Diabetes Data Group (NDDG) or the IADPSG,and the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes related to GDM was analyzed.Results According to the cut off values of NDDG and IADPSG criteria,the prevalence of gestational glucose metabolism abnormalities was 8.4% and 18.9% (P <0.01) respectively,and the prevalence of cesarean section (52.5% vs.46.0% ,P <0.01),macrosomia (7.5% vs.6.3% ,P <0.05),neonatal hypoglycemia (1.6% vs.1.0% ,P <0.01),and perinatal death (0.5% vs.0.2% ,P <0.01); the prevalence was significantly lower when IADPSG criteria were applied.The prevalence of macrosomia,cesarean section,neonatal hypoglycemia,pregnancy induced hypertension,etc.was also higher in the GDM group than in the normal group.The prevalence of cesarean section (62.3%) and macrosomia (14.8%) was the highest in untreated mild GDM patients.Conclusions Our results indicated that treatment/intervention of women with GDM identified by IADPSG criteria was related to significantly lower risk of multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes.Such findings provide support for applying IADPSG criteria in China."
"Prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus of Chinese populations in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan","This article reviews and describes trends and differences in prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus of Chinese populations in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan based on literatures published in the MEDLINE Advanced database (January 1966–October 2005) in both Chinese and English languages. Chinese populations in Hong Kong and Taiwan have significant higher prevalence rates of diabetes than their Mainland counterparts, with odds ratios 1.5 (95% confidence intervals: 1.4, 1.7) and 2.0 (95% confidence intervals: 1.8, 2.2), respectively in 1995–2003 adjusted for age and diagnostic criteria. Using stratified diagnostic criteria; the odds ratios in Hong Kong and Taiwan were consistently higher than Mainland China for the periods of 1985–1994 and 1995–2003. A large proportion, i.e. 68.6% (95% confidence intervals: 67.4%, 69.7%) of diabetic patients remains undiagnosed in Mainland China as compared to 52.6% (95% confidence intervals: 49.8%, 55.5%) undiagnosed in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The prevalence rates of diabetes and impaired glucose toleranceof the Chinese populations rise in older age groups. In tandem with economic development and change toward lifestyle that is lack of physical activity and rich in high-fat diet, prevalence of diabetes of the Chinese populations are on the rise. If the undiagnosed individuals left uncontrolled, they are subject to higher risks of developing diabetes and its complications. These will increase the burdens of diabetes medically and financially."
